Footy+API v1.02
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - Added font/background colour options toward the beginning.
  - Removed much of the code from loop() and setup() and put them in functions
  - Changed the cutoff time for accessing tips from the API to 8pm Wednesday
  - Added a small notification bottom right if the tips are coming from the API

Footy_API v1.01
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Added a way to save the footy tips after Wednesday so that if the API changes the tips, my registered tips are still used.
  - required LittleFS
  - required time and ntp libraries
  - added a startup screen
  - tidied up the serial port output

Footy_API v1.00
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The first version to retrieve live tips and compare them with the actual scores, giving a tally.
  - changed the variables to char[] from const char* so that they didn't get lost when the JSON doc got destroyed.
