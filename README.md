# ESP32 AFL-footy-tipping
An esp32 project that works with a TFT screen to collect AFL footy tips and then update scores and your tip results. 

Written in the Arduino IDE.

Comments in the code might help understand what is happening.

This code uses the TFT_eSPI library. In this library you have to set up the User.Setup.h file in the library folder according to your own connections.

If you have your screen working properly using the TFT_eSPI library, then this code is good to go (nearly).

Report any issues and I will try to help
